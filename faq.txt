* Max file size is 50MB, hopefully I won't have to change this to a even lower number. (read: don't be an ass).
* No Child porn, anything else goes until I get a lawsuit I guess. (unless its a virus, because that goes into the being an ass category).
* All filetypes are allowed, ALL! (gif,exe,jpg,rar,ass,srt,etc,etc).
* Any file can be removed or replaced at any time for any reason.
* No logs are kept, no logs over uploading nor over downloading. This can be temp enabled to stop certain spamming (read: child porn or such).
* a/i/pomf.se is hosted as for now on 500mbit server and Cloudflare's CDN helps out a lot, I'm on a restrained budget and this costs a lot so please don't be an ass.
* I want to deliver the best free service I can without ads or such so donations are very welcome via the donate button on the front page (pomf.se).
* Viruses will be removed if detected most of the time, this is to not cause further damage in form of i/a/pomf.se ending up on blacklists and whatnot. (read: IT ALREADY FUCKING IS!).
* For removal of a file or such contact me at neku@pomf.se.
